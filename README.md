===
A lightweight JavaScript scaffolding for building SPA with some structure but without the heavy framework dependency and lock-in

TODO:
——————
- Need to fix the build process to use webpack & yarn instead of Gulp, Codekit & Bower
- Need to cleanup the code formatting done by Prettier
- Need to create a demo build
- Probably have more code that needs to be cleaned up

## Templates
[HandlebarsJs](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is what is used for rendering HTML to the screen through the use of templates.
The handlebar templates (located inside the templates folder, utilizing the .handlebars extension) are combined into a single javascript file and placed into a /compiled folder within /templates.

Handlebar files get compiled via the command line

	/{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_INSTALL}/.nvm/v0.12.0/bin/handlebars 
	/{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_FILES}/templates -f 
	/{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_FILES}/templates/compiled/nova.templates.js -k each -k if -k unless

Some GUI applications can be configured to do this automatically by calling a script on save (Codekit, WebStorm, etc..)
A Grunt/Gulp type process can also be used to trigger compiler script

## Style Sheets
The `nova.css` file is generated by compiling the nova.scss file which imports all other SCSS files. All SCSS file get compiled to a single minified CSS and is output to the css folder for referencing inside the HTML page
* `_variables.scss` stores color, path, and sizing references used by the remaining scss imports (e.g. `_layout.scss`, `_sidebar.scss` etc)

## JavaScript
### Dependancies
Currently the only real dependancy is that this has been written using jQuery syntax.
### Organization
The `nova.js` file handles the communication between different views and the data files (this would be the Controler file in MVC). This file imports all view, module and utility files and compiles all of these files into a single output file (`nova-min.js`) that is referenced in the HTML page.
* View and Module files handle what gets displayed on screen (this would be our View files in MVC)
	* Views should (at the very least) contain functionality for each primary navigation link. In many cases a View may also be created for sub pages.
	* Modules are used for functionality in views that may be shared amongst multiple views (ex. data tables)
* The `nova.data.js` file handles all REST api calls from the front end (this would be the 'M' - Model file in MVC). This file is included in the `nova.js` compilation sequence
* In addition to the standard MVC files we also have a few other files that are included
	* The `nova.config.js` file is used to manage hard coded data that may at some point be moved to a RESTful call (ex. textKeys). This file is included in the `nova.js` compilation sequence.
	* The `nova.logger.js` file is a passive utility file that handles whether `console.log()` statements are output to the browser console. This is controled by added a URL parameter (`debug=true`) to the URL in the browser address bar. This file is included in the `nova.js` compilation sequence
	* The `nova.utilities.js` file is another utility file that contains common standalone methods that can be used by any view or module and acts as a singleton. Utility methods are called using the following format `NovaUtilities.methodName(arguments);`. For example, to call the `isObject` utility method to validate whether the argument item you pass is a valid object, the call would look like `NovaUtilities.isObject({name:'foo', type:'bar'});`. This file is included in the `nova.js` compilation sequence
### Views
Views are basically the code required to render a "page" in the application (the 'V' in MVC). Views can load other views and modules, but should be mostly self contained javaScript code/references to render what is needed on the screen for a single page/screen/view. These files are included in the `nova.js` compilation sequence.
### Modules
Modules can be thought of as components/ They are similar to views, however rather than being spcific to a single page a module is something that could be shared in multiple views. For example, a DataTables module may be loaded into any view that requires a table to be displays. This helps reduce code repetition for common/shared pieces. These files are included in the `nova.js` compilation sequence.
### Framework
The `nova.framework.js` file is used to import and combine dependancies from external sources and helper files. Such as plugins, libraries, 3rd party code, shared resources, etc.. This file is *not* included in the `nova.js` compilation sequence and is loaded/compiled separately to `nova.framework-min.js` and is referenced separately in the HTML page.
## Build Process
Currently there is a gulp script that can handle file compilation. The Gulp script also imports a [code-kit scanner utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codekit-scanner) to convert codekit append/prepends into import statements prior to compilation.
