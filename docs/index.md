A lightweight JavaScript scaffolding for building SPA with some structure but without the heavy framework dependency and lock-in

## Templates
[HandlebarsJs](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is what is used for rendering HTML to the screen through the use of templates.
The handlebar templates (located inside the templates folder, utilizing the .handlebars extension) are combined into a single javascript file and placed into a /compiled folder within /templates.

Handlebar files get compiled via the command line

	/{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_INSTALL}/.nvm/v0.12.0/bin/handlebars 
	/{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_FILES}/templates -f 
	/{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_FILES}/templates/compiled/nova.templates.js -k each -k if -k unless

Some GUI applications can be configured to do this automatically by calling a script on save (Codekit, WebStorm, etc..)
A Grunt/Gulp type process can also be used to trigger compiler script

## Style Sheets
The nova.css file is generated by compiling the nova.scss file which imports all other SCSS files. All SCSS file get compiled to a single minified CSS and is output to the css folder for referencing inside the HTML page
* _variables.scss stores color, path, and sizing references used by the remaining scss imports (e.g. _layout.scss, sidebar.scss etc)

## JavaScript
### Dependancies
Currentlu the only real dependancy is that this has been written using jQuery syntax.
### Organization
The nova.js file handles the communication between different views and the data files (this would be the Controler file in MVC)
* View and Module files handle what gets displayed on screen (this would be our View files in MVC)
	* â€‹Views should (at the very least) contain functionality for each left hand navigation link. In many cases a View may also be created for sub pages.
	* Modules are used for functionality in views that may be shared amongst multiple views (ex. data tables)
* The nova.data.js file handle all REST api calls from the front end (this would be the 'M' - Model file in MVC)
* In addition to the standard MVC files we also have a few other files in each app
	* The nova.config.js file is used to manage hard coded data that may at some point be moved to a RESTful call (ex. textKeys)
	* Framework files - these files are used to import and combine dependancies from external sources and helper files. Such as plugins, libraries, 3rd party code, shared resources, etc..

### Views
Views are basically the code required to render a "page" in the application (the 'V' in MVC). Views can load other views and modules, but should be mostly self contained javaScript code/references to render what is needed on the screen for a single page/screen/view.
### Modules
Modules can be thought of as components/ They are similar to views, however rather than being spcific to a single page a module is something that could be shared in multiple views. For example, a DataTables module may be loaded into any view that requires a table to be displays. This helps reduce code repetition for common/shared pieces
