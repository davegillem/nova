<p>A lightweight JavaScript scaffolding for building SPA with some structure but without the heavy framework dependency and lock-in

<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">HandlebarsJs</a> is what is used for rendering HTML to the screen through the use of templates.
The handlebar templates (located inside the templates folder, utilizing the .handlebars extension) are combined into a single javascript file and placed into a /compiled folder within /templates.</p>

<p>Handlebar files get compiled via the command line</p>

<pre><code>/{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_INSTALL}/.nvm/v0.12.0/bin/handlebars /{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_FILES}/templates -f /{PATH_TO_YOUR_LOCAL_FILES}/templates/compiled/nova.templates.js -k each -k if -k unless
</code></pre>

<p>Some GUI applications can be configured to do this automatically by calling a script on save (Codekit, WebStorm, etc..)
A Grunt/Gulp type process can also be used to trigger compiler script</p>

<h2 id="stylesheets">Style Sheets</h2>

<hr />

<p>The nova.css file is generated by compiling the vova.scss file which imports all other SCSS files. All SCSS file get compiled to CSS and minified and output to the css folder for referencing insid ethe HTML page</p>

<ul>
<li>_variables.scss stores color, path, and sizing references used by the remaining scss imports (e.g. _layout.scss, sidebar.scss etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>

<p>The nova.js file handles the communication between different views and the data files (this would be the Controler file in MVC)</p>

<ul>
<li>View and Module files handle what gets displayed on screen (this would be our View files in MVC)

<ul>
<li>â€‹Views should (at the very least) contain functionality for each left hand navigation link. In many cases a View may also be created for sub pages.</li>
<li>Modules are used for functionality in views that may be shared amongst multiple views (ex. data tables)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The nova.data.js file handle all REST api calls from the front end (this would be the Model file in MVC)</li>
<li>In addition to the standard MVC files we also have a few other files in each app

<ul>
<li>The nova.config.js file is used to manage hard coded data that may at some point be moved to a RESTful call (ex. textKeys)</li>
<li>Framework files - these files are used to import and combine dependancies from external sources and helper files. Such as plugins, libraries, 3rd party code, shared resources, etc..</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
