# nova Documentation
A lightweight JavaScript scaffolding for building SPA with some structure but without the heavy framework dependency and lock-in

TODO:
——————
- Need to fix the build process to use webpack or Gulp instead of Codekit
- Need to cleanup the code formatting done by Prettier
- Need to create documentation
- Need to create a demo build
- Probably have more code that needs to be stripped out, cleaned up
